Hey there! No idea how you ended up here, but I'm glad you're here.

It might be a good idea to read my [philosophy](philosophy) regarding blogs before you continue :)

## Content

I'm mostly doing development related content, because I don't feel like I'm wise enough
to educate in any other field *yet*.

Here are the main topics I'm covering right now:

<Cards>
	<Card icon={<DatabaseIcon />} title="Databases" description="Migrations, schema best practices, performance optimizations." />
	<Card icon={<SiApple />} title='Apple development' description="Swift, SwiftUI, and XCode related life-hacks. Especially around despised topics, like Apple Watch development." />
</Cards>

### Leaving feedback

Please do send feedback via the buttons at the bottom of each page! I get them as instant messages,
and they are very helpful in determining which fields I need to improve upon (probably a lot).
