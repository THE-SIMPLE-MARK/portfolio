## Core

I'm pretty new to writing blogs, and therefore I have a few hot takes:

- I don't write "to write". I only write if my content contributes something meaningful
to the world: lessons I've learned, personal experiences with different things, and guides. 
- You'll find that most of these entries have a mix of professional, casual, serious, and funny
tones. This is how I feel comfortable writing, so it is what it is. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

This'll be expanded upon as I discover more of my writing style. I'm pretty new to this stuff, as I said.
